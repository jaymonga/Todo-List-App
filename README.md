# Todo-List-App

This is a basic to-do list template. Use this has a starter template. This already is set up with the browsers local storage so that the data submitted stays on a users device even on page refresh or reload using the browsers database. Also as soon as the user inputs an item to the todo list the preset items get removed. On each page reload the code checks to see if anything is stored on the local storage and then displays and removes the preset values(play with the code to define the key so that it will only load items in the specific key value pair)
